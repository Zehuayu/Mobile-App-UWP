## what is UWP

The Universal Windows Platform (UWP) is the app platform for Windows 10. You can develop apps for UWP with just one API set, one app package, and one store to reach all Windows 10 devices – PC, tablet, phone, Xbox, HoloLens, Surface Hub and more. It’s easier to support a number of screen sizes, and also a variety of interaction models, whether it be touch, mouse and keyboard, a game controller, or a pen. At the core of UWP apps is the idea that users want their experiences to be mobile across ALL their devices, and they want to use whatever device is most convenient or productive for the task at hand.

## what is MVVM

The MVVM pattern lends itself naturally to XAML application platforms such as Silverlight. This is because the MVVM pattern leverages some of the specific capabilities of Silverlight, such as data binding, commands, and behaviors. MVVM is similar to many other patterns that separate the responsibility for the appearance and layout of the UI from the responsibility for the presentation logic; for example, if you're familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, you'll find that MVVM has many similar concepts.

## what is different between MVVM and MVC

The two patterns crop up, in different ways, in both ASP.Net and Silverlight/WPF development.

For ASP.Net, MVVM is used to two-way bind data within views. This is usually a client-side implementation (e.g. using Knockout.js). MVC on the other hand is a way of separating concerns on the server-side.

For Silverlight and WPF, the MVVM pattern is more encompassing and can appear to act as a replacement for MVC (or other patterns of organising software into separate responsibilities). One assumption, that frequently came out of this pattern, was that the ViewModel simply replaced the controller in MVC (as if you could just substitute VM for C in the acronym and all would be forgiven)...

## The plan of development

1. Design the UI

2. Making the function of App in the plan 

3. Coding 

4. Testing

5. Upload Appstore

## Cloud Introduction

Azure can give an interface to mobile app, App all data can send azure data, Azure store this information and make table, user can make operation on website and review this information.

## MVVM problem

coder have to definaly undestand how does every UI tool using, Bindind function some times has bug and tough to fix up
